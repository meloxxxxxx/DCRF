Write a step-by-step deduction to solve the following question:
[PREMISE 1] If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
[PREMISE 2] People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
[PREMISE 3] If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 4] All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
[PREMISE 5] All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 6] Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.



[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.


response:
This is a complex reasoning problem, but step-by-step deduction can help analyze the premises systematically. Let's work through the problem carefully to determine whether the statement about Bonnie performing in school talent shows often is **true**, **false**, or **uncertain**.

---

### Step 1: Summarize the premises and their implications.
To solve the question, we first analyze the provided premises:

1. **Premise 1:** If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
   - This means performing in school talent shows implies being engaged with school events.

2. **Premise 2:** People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
   - This is an "either/or" statement: Everyone belongs to one of these two categories.

3. **Premise 3:** If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
   - Chaperoning dances implies not being a student at the school.

4. **Premise 4:** All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
   - Being inactive and disinterested necessarily means a person chaperones dances.

5. **Premise 5:** All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
   - Focusing on academic careers implies being a student at the school.

6. **Premise 6:** Bonnie either:
   - Both attends and is very engaged with school events, and is a student who attends the school.
   - Or neither attends and is very engaged with school events, nor is a student who attends the school.

---

### Step 2: Interpret Bonnie's two possible cases (Premise 6).

Premise 6 sets up a dichotomy for Bonnie:
1. **Case 1:** Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, and she is a student who attends the school.
   - This aligns with the first half of Premise 6.

2. **Case 2:** Bonnie neither attends nor is engaged with school events, and she is not a student who attends the school.
   - This aligns with the second half of Premise 6.

Only **one** of these two cases can be true because Premise 6 is exclusive.

---

### Step 3: Consider whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.

From **Premise 2**, people either:
1. Perform in school talent shows often, or
2. Are inactive and disinterested members of their community.

If Bonnie performs in school talent shows frequently, then according to **Premise 1**, she must attend and be very engaged with school events. This fits **Case 1** from Premise 6.

If Bonnie is inactive and disinterested, then she chaperones high school dances (**Premise 4**) and must not be a student at the school (**Premise 3**). This aligns with **Case 2**.

Thus, determining whether Bonnie performs in talent shows depends on which case—Case 1 or Case 2—is true about her.

---

### Step 4: Connect the cases with the premises.
Let's consider each case:

#### Case 1: Bonnie attends and is engaged with school events, and she is a student at the school.
- If Bonnie attends school events and is very engaged, then **Premise 1** suggests that she could perform in school talent shows often. This is logical because performing talent shows inherently implies engagement with school events.
- Additionally, **Premise 5** implies Bonnie is a student if she is furthering her academic career, and her engagement with school events would likely support this idea.

#### Case 2: Bonnie neither attends nor is engaged with school events, and she is not a student at the school.
- Here, Bonnie would align with being inactive and disinterested (from Premise 2). **Premise 4** asserts that inactive and disinterested people chaperone dances.
- Also, **Premise 3** states that people who chaperone dances are not students, consistent with Case 2.
- In this case, Bonnie cannot perform in talent shows, as performing requires attending and being engaged with school events (**Premise 1**).

---

### Step 5: Decide whether the statement is true, false, or uncertain.
From Premise 6, Bonnie falls into **one** of two cases:
1. **If Case 1 is true**, Bonnie attends and is engaged with school events. She could, therefore, perform in school talent shows often.
2. **If Case 2 is true**, Bonnie does not attend or engage with school events. She cannot perform in school talent shows often.

We are not given enough information elsewhere in the premises to conclude which case is definitively true for Bonnie. Both cases are logically possible.

---

### Step 6: Final conclusion.
The statement **"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often"** is **uncertain** because we do not have enough information to determine whether she belongs to Case 1 (engaged and attending school events) or Case 2 (inactive and chaperoning dances).

   - This is an "either/or" statement: Everyone belongs to one of these two categories.

3. **Premise 3:** If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
   - Chaperoning dances implies not being a student at the school.

4. **Premise 4:** All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
   - Being inactive and disinterested necessarily means a person chaperones dances.

5. **Premise 5:** All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
   - Focusing on academic careers implies being a student at the school.

6. **Premise 6:** Bonnie either:
   - Both attends and is very engaged with school events, and is a student who attends the school.
   - Or neither attends and is very engaged with school events, nor is a student who attends the school.

### Step 2: Interpret Bonnie's two possible cases (Premise 6).

Premise 6 sets up a dichotomy for Bonnie:
1. **Case 1:** Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, and she is a student who attends the school.
   - This aligns with the first half of Premise 6.

2. **Case 2:** Bonnie neither attends nor is engaged with school events, and she is not a student who attends the school.
   - This aligns with the second half of Premise 6.

Only **one** of these two cases can be true because Premise 6 is exclusive.

### Step 3: Consider whether Bonnie performs in school talent shows often.

From **Premise 2**, people either:

2. Are inactive and disinterested members of their community.

If Bonnie performs in school talent shows frequently, then according to **Premise 1**, she must attend and be very engaged with school events. This fits **Case 1** from Premise 6.

If Bonnie is inactive and disinterested, then she chaperones high school dances (**Premise 4**) and must not be a student at the school (**Premise 3**). This aligns with **Case 2**.

Thus, determining whether Bonnie performs in talent shows depends on which case—Case 1 or Case 2—is true about her.

- Also, **Premise 3** states that people who chaperone dances are not students, consistent with Case 2.
- In this case, Bonnie cannot perform in talent shows, as performing requires attending and being engaged with school events (**Premise 1**).

---

### Step 5: Decide whether the statement is true, false, or uncertain.
From Premise 6, Bonnie falls into **one** of two cases:
1. **If Case 1 is true**, Bonnie attends and is engaged with school events. She could, therefore, perform in school talent shows often.
2. **If Case 2 is true**, Bonnie does not attend or engage with school events. She cannot perform in school talent shows often.

We are not given enough information elsewhere in the premises to conclude which case is definitively true for Bonnie. Both cases are logically possible.

### Step 6: Final conclusion.
The statement **"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often"** is **uncertain** because we do not have enough information to determine whether she belongs to Case 1 (engaged and attending school events) or Case 2 (inactive and chaperoning dances).

Write a step-by-step deduction to solve the following question:
[PREMISE 1] If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
[PREMISE 2] People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
[PREMISE 3] If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 4] All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
[PREMISE 5] All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 6] Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.



[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.


response:
### Step-by-Step Deduction 

#### Recap the premises:
1. **Premise 1:** If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
2. **Premise 2:** People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
3. **Premise 3:** If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
4. **Premise 4:** All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
5. **Premise 5:** All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
6. **Premise 6:** Bonnie either:
   - (a) Both attends and is very engaged with school events **and** is a student who attends the school, OR
   - (b) Neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor** is a student who attends the school.

#### Question Statement:
"If **Bonnie** is either:
   1. Both **a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities** **and** chaperones high school dances, OR
   2. Neither **a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities,**
then Bonnie is either **a student who attends the school** or **an inactive and disinterested member of the community**."

### Deduction Process:

#### Step 1: Analyze the question's two scenarios for Bonnie.
The question considers two possibilities for Bonnie:
1. Bonnie **both wishes to further her academic career** **and** chaperones high school dances.
   - From **Premise 5**, we know all young children/teenagers who wish to further their academic careers are **students who attend the school**.
   - From **Premise 3**, we know anyone who chaperones high school dances is **not** a student who attends the school.
   - Therefore, Bonnie **cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances simultaneously**, as these two conditions are logically incompatible.

2. Bonnie **neither wishes to further her academic career nor is a young child or teenager**.
   - If Bonnie does not wish to further her academic career and is not a young child or teenager, then **Premise 5** is irrelevant to her.
   - In this case, Bonnie could potentially fall into the category of an **inactive and disinterested member of the community** (from Premise 2).

#### Step 2: Determine whether Bonnie can fall into the categories specified in the conclusion.
The question concludes that Bonnie would end up in one of two categories:
1. **A student who attends the school**: This is logically possible only if Bonnie satisfies the conditions in **Premise 5** (i.e., she is a young child or teenager wishing to further her academic career and is engaged with school events). However:
   - If Bonnie is a student, she **cannot** chaperone high school dances (**Premise 3**)—but the question's first scenario includes chaperoning dances, so this is unlikely.

2. **An inactive and disinterested member of the community**: 
   - According to **Premise 4**, all inactive and disinterested members of the community also chaperone high school dances.
   - If Bonnie does not wish to further her academic career, she could logically fall into this category.

#### Step 3: Assess the truth of the question statement.
Based on the premises and logical deduction:
- Bonnie **cannot both be a young child or teenager wishing to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances**, as these statements conflict (**Premises 3 and 5**). Therefore, the first scenario in the question is false.
- If Bonnie is **neither a young child nor a teenager**, she fits the profile of an inactive and disinterested member of the community (**Premises 2 and 4**).
- Therefore, in either case, Bonnie can either be **a student who attends the school** or **an inactive and disinterested member of the community**.

#### Answer:
The statement is **true**.

[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances.


response:
To determine whether the statement *"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances"* is true, false, or uncertain, let’s deduce the answer step by step based on the premises provided:

---

### **Key Definitions from the Premises:**
1. **Premise 1**: If people perform in school talent shows often → then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
2. **Premise 2**: People either perform in school talent shows often **OR** are inactive and disinterested members of their community (but not both).
3. **Premise 3**: If people chaperone high school dances → then they are **not students who attend the school**.
4. **Premise 4**: All inactive and disinterested members of their community → chaperone high school dances.
5. **Premise 5**: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers → are students who attend the school.
6. **Premise 6**: Bonnie is either:
   - **(Case A)** Both attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school, OR
   - **(Case B)** Neither attends and is very engaged with school events NOR is a student who attends the school.

---

### **Step-by-Step Deduction**

---

#### **Step 1**: What does it mean to "wish to further her academic career" (Premise 5)?
- According to Premise 5, all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers are **students who attend the school.**
- Therefore, if Bonnie wishes to further her academic career, Bonnie must be a **student who attends the school**.

---

#### **Step 2**: Can Bonnie chaperone high school dances (Premise 3 and Premise 4)?
- According to Premise 3, if someone chaperones high school dances, then they are **not students who attend the school**.
- According to Premise 4, all inactive and disinterested members of their community **chaperone high school dances**.
- Therefore, **anyone who chaperones high school dances cannot be a student who attends the school.**

---

#### **Step 3**: Analyze Bonnie’s specific case (Premise 6).
- Premise 6 tells us that Bonnie is either:
  - (**Case A**) attends and is very engaged with school events **and is a student who attends the school.**
  - (**Case B**) neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor is a student who attends the school.**

- From **Case A**:
  - If Bonnie is a student who attends the school (as she is in Case A), she **cannot chaperone high school dances** (based on Premise 3, since chaperones are not students).
  - If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, she is **not inactive and disinterested**, meaning she cannot chaperone high school dances (based on Premise 4 as well).

- From **Case B**:
  - If Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school, Bonnie **may** chaperone high school dances (since she could be an inactive and disinterested member of the community who chaperones dances, per Premise 4).
  - However, if Bonnie doesn’t attend the school, she **cannot wish to further her academic career** (based on Premise 5).

---

#### **Step 4**: Combine deductions to evaluate the given statement.
The statement claims: **"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances."**

- If Bonnie wishes to further her academic career, she must be a **student who attends the school** (Premise 5).
  - If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she **cannot chaperone high school dances** (Premise 3).
- Conversely, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she **cannot be a student who attends the school** (Premise 3).
  - If Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, she **cannot wish to further her academic career** (Premise 5).

Thus, it is **impossible** for Bonnie to both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances simultaneously.

### **Conclusion**
The statement **"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances"** is **TRUE** based on the premises provided.

  - (**Case B**) neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor is a student who attends the school.**

- From **Case A**:
  - If Bonnie is a student who attends the school (as she is in Case A), she **cannot chaperone high school dances** (based on Premise 3, since chaperones are not students).
  - If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, she is **not inactive and disinterested**, meaning she cannot chaperone high school dances (based on Premise 4 as well).

- From **Case B**:
  - If Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school, Bonnie **may** chaperone high school dances (since she could be an inactive and disinterested member of the community who chaperones dances, per Premise 4).
  - However, if Bonnie doesn’t attend the school, she **cannot wish to further her academic career** (based on Premise 5).

---

#### **Step 4**: Combine deductions to evaluate the given statement.
The statement claims: **"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances."**

- If Bonnie wishes to further her academic career, she must be a **student who attends the school** (Premise 5).
  - If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she **cannot chaperone high school dances** (Premise 3).
- Conversely, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she **cannot be a student who attends the school** (Premise 3).
  - If Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, she **cannot wish to further her academic career** (Premise 5).

Thus, it is **impossible** for Bonnie to both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances simultaneously.

---

### **Conclusion**
The statement **"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances"** is **TRUE** based on the premises provided.
###

Write a step-by-step deduction to solve the following question:
[PREMISE 1] If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
[PREMISE 2] People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
[PREMISE 3] If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 4] All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
[PREMISE 5] All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 6] Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.

[PREMISE 7] If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, Bonnie cannot chaperone high school dances.
[PREMISE 8] If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, Bonnie is not a student who attends the school.

[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances.

###
[TRIAL 1]
In this former trial, you made the following subconclusions to reach the answer. Through rigid verification, we denote your correct(i.e. true) and incorrect (i.e. false or uncertain) subconclusions.
[Your trial]:
To determine whether the statement *"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances"* is true, false, or uncertain, let’s deduce the answer step by step based on the premises provided:

---

### **Key Definitions from the Premises:**
1. **Premise 1**: If people perform in school talent shows often → then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
2. **Premise 2**: People either perform in school talent shows often **OR** are inactive and disinterested members of their community (but not both).
3. **Premise 3**: If people chaperone high school dances → then they are **not students who attend the school**.
4. **Premise 4**: All inactive and disinterested members of their community → chaperone high school dances.
5. **Premise 5**: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers → are students who attend the school.
6. **Premise 6**: Bonnie is either:
   - **(Case A)** Both attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school, OR
   - **(Case B)** Neither attends and is very engaged with school events NOR is a student who attends the school.

---

### **Step-by-Step Deduction**

---

#### **Step 1**: What does it mean to "wish to further her academic career" (Premise 5)?
- According to Premise 5, all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers are **students who attend the school.**
- Therefore, if Bonnie wishes to further her academic career, Bonnie must be a **student who attends the school**.

---

#### **Step 2**: Can Bonnie chaperone high school dances (Premise 3 and Premise 4)?
- According to Premise 3, if someone chaperones high school dances, then they are **not students who attend the school**.
- According to Premise 4, all inactive and disinterested members of their community **chaperone high school dances**.
- Therefore, **anyone who chaperones high school dances cannot be a student who attends the school.**

---

#### **Step 3**: Analyze Bonnie’s specific case (Premise 6).
- Premise 6 tells us that Bonnie is either:
  - (**Case A**) attends and is very engaged with school events **and is a student who attends the school.**
  - (**Case B**) neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor is a student who attends the school.**

- From **Case A**:
  - If Bonnie is a student who attends the school (as she is in Case A), she **cannot chaperone high school dances** (based on Premise 3, since chaperones are not students).
  - If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, she is **not inactive and disinterested**, meaning she cannot chaperone high school dances (based on Premise 4 as well).

- From **Case B**:
  - If Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school, Bonnie **may** chaperone high school dances (since she could be an inactive and disinterested member of the community who chaperones dances, per Premise 4).
  - However, if Bonnie doesn’t attend the school, she **cannot wish to further her academic career** (based on Premise 5).

---

#### **Step 4**: Combine deductions to evaluate the given statement.
The statement claims: **"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances."**

- If Bonnie wishes to further her academic career, she must be a **student who attends the school** (Premise 5).
  - If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she **cannot chaperone high school dances** (Premise 3).
- Conversely, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she **cannot be a student who attends the school** (Premise 3).
  - If Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, she **cannot wish to further her academic career** (Premise 5).

Thus, it is **impossible** for Bonnie to both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances simultaneously.

---

### **Conclusion**
The statement **"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances"** is **TRUE** based on the premises provided.

[Your correct subconclusions]:
If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, Bonnie cannot chaperone high school dances.
If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, Bonnie is not a student who attends the school.

[Your incorrect subconclusions]:
If Bonnie wishes to further her academic career, Bonnie must be a student who attends the school.
If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, Bonnie cannot wish to further her academic career.


response:
Thank you for referencing the trial and clarifying which subconclusions were correct and incorrect. Let's carefully revisit the deduction process while correcting any mistakes made in the previous trial, ensuring logical consistency and accuracy based on the premises.

### **Key Definitions from Premises**
1. **Premise 1**: If people perform in school talent shows often → then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
2. **Premise 2**: People either perform in school talent shows often OR are inactive and disinterested members of their community (but not both).
3. **Premise 3**: If people chaperone high school dances → then they are **not students who attend the school.**
4. **Premise 4**: All inactive and disinterested members of their community → chaperone high school dances.
5. **Premise 5**: All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers → are students who attend the school.
6. **Premise 6**: Bonnie is either:
   - (**Case A**) Both attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school, OR
   - (**Case B**) Neither attends and is very engaged with school events NOR is a student who attends the school.
7. **Premise 7**: If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, Bonnie cannot chaperone high school dances.
8. **Premise 8**: If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, Bonnie is not a student who attends the school.

---

### **Step-by-Step Deduction**

---

#### **Step 1**: Clarify what "wishing to further her academic career" implies.
- From **Premise 5**, all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers are **students who attend the school**.
- Therefore, if Bonnie wishes to further her academic career, Bonnie must be a **student who attends the school**.

---

#### **Step 2**: Clarify what chaperoning high school dances implies.
- From **Premise 3** and **Premise 7**, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances:
  - Bonnie **cannot** be a student who attends the school.
- From **Premise 4**, all inactive and disinterested members of their community **chaperone** high school dances.
- Therefore, chaperoning high school dances requires that Bonnie is:
  - Not a student who attends the school (Premises 3 and 7).
  - Likely classified as an inactive and disinterested member of her community (Premise 4).

---

#### **Step 3**: Analyze Bonnie's "status" as per Premise 6.
Based on **Premise 6**, Bonnie is either:
- (**Case A**) Both attends and is very engaged with school events **and is a student who attends the school**, OR
- (**Case B**) Neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor is a student who attends the school**.

- **Case A**: 
  - If Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events, she is **not inactive and disinterested** and therefore cannot chaperone high school dances (Premise 4).
  - In addition, as a student who attends the school, Bonnie **cannot chaperone high school dances** (Premises 3 and 7).

- **Case B**: 
  - If Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school, Bonnie **may chaperone high school dances** (Premise 4).
  - However, if Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, then she **cannot wish to further her academic career** (Premise 5).

---

#### **Step 4**: Can Bonnie both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances?
- If Bonnie wishes to further her academic career, she is a **student who attends the school** (Premise 5).
- If Bonnie is a student who attends the school, she **cannot** chaperone high school dances (Premises 3 and 7).
- Conversely, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she is **not** a student who attends the school (Premises 3 and 8), which means she **cannot** wish to further her academic career.

Thus, Bonnie **cannot simultaneously** wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances. The two conditions are logically incompatible based on the premises.

---

### **Conclusion**
The statement **"Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances"** is **TRUE**.

### Explanation:
1. **Formulas(assumptions):**  
   The premises are written between `formulas(assumptions).` and `end_of_list.` using the specified logical format:
   - Universal quantification is expressed as `all x`.
   - Implications (`->`), conjunctions (`&`), disjunctions (`|`), and negations (`-`) are used to construct the premises.

2. **Formulas(goals):**  
   The question (the statement to be proved) is written between `formulas(goals).` and `end_of_list.`:
   - The goal seeks to establish whether Bonnie cannot simultaneously wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances (`-(WishesFurtherAcademicCareer(bonnie) & ChaperoneDances(bonnie))`).

3. Additional goals were added, such as verifying the existence of a student who chaperones dances (`exists x (Student(x) & ChaperoneDances(x))`), to test related conditions that may support proof determination.

This input file adheres to the required Prover9 format and encodes the logical relationships from the premises and the question correctly.

Write a step-by-step deduction to solve the following question:
[PREMISE 1] If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
[PREMISE 2] People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
[PREMISE 3] If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 4] All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
[PREMISE 5] All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 6] Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.

You can use the following hints as additional premises. They are proposed in your former trials and are proved to be true through rigid verification:
[PREMISE 7] Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances.

[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.


response:
To determine whether Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community, we will carefully analyze the premises step-by-step and apply deductions.

---

### STEP 1: Resolve Bonnie's behavior from Premise 6
[Premise 6] states:  
Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events **and** is a student who attends the school,  
**OR**  
she neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor** is a student who attends the school.

Thus, Bonnie can only exist in one of these two mutually exclusive cases:  
1. **Case A**: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events **and** is a student who attends the school.  
2. **Case B**: Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor** is a student who attends the school.

---

### STEP 2: Use Premise 1 and Premise 2 to deduce conditions for engagement with school events
[Premise 1] states:  
If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.  

[Premise 2] states:  
People either perform in school talent shows often **or** are inactive and disinterested members of their community.  

From Premise 2, we know that people are split into two categories:  
1. Those who perform in school talent shows often.  
   Based on [Premise 1], these individuals attend and are very engaged with school events.  
2. Those who are inactive and disinterested members of their community.  
   Based on [Premise 4], these individuals chaperone high school dances.

This means **engagement with school events and being inactive/disinterested are opposites**.

---

### STEP 3: Determine if Bonnie can chaperone high school dances
[Premise 3] states:  
If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.  

[Premise 4] states:  
All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.  

From Premise 3 and Premise 4, we conclude:  
- Bonnie **cannot** be a student who attends the school **if** she chaperones high school dances.  
- Thus, anyone who chaperones high school dances **must** be inactive and disinterested.

---

### STEP 4: Use Premise 7 to eliminate contradictions
[Premise 7] states:  
Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances.

We know from [Premise 5] that:  
Young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers **are students who attend the school**.  

Thus, if Bonnie **wishes to further her academic career**, she must be a student who attends the school.  
But, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances (from Premise 3 and Premise 4), she **cannot** be a student who attends the school.  

Therefore, Bonnie **cannot simultaneously** wish to further her academic career **and** chaperone high school dances.

---

### STEP 5: Deduce Bonnie's category
From Step 1, Bonnie must fall into one of two categories:
1. **Case A**: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events **and** is a student who attends the school.  
   - In this case, Bonnie performs in school talent shows often (Premises 1 and 2).  
   - Bonnie cannot chaperone high school dances (Premise 3).  
2. **Case B**: Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor** is a student who attends the school.  
   - In this case, Bonnie **must** be an inactive and disinterested member of her community (Premise 2).  
   - Bonnie chaperones high school dances (Premises 3 and 4).  

---

### STEP 6: Answer the question
[Question]: Is the statement **"Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community"** true, false, or uncertain?

From Step 5, Bonnie must be in **Case A** or **Case B**.  
- If Bonnie is in Case A, she is a student who attends the school.  
- If Bonnie is in Case B, she is an inactive and disinterested member of her community.  

Thus, the statement **"Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community"** is **TRUE**.

### FINAL ANSWER: **TRUE**
input:
You are a helpful assistant.
Solve the following First-Order Logic inference question:
[PREMISE 1] If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
[PREMISE 2] People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
[PREMISE 3] If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 4] All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
[PREMISE 5] All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 6] Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.

You can use the following hints as additional premises:
[PREMISE 7] Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances.

[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
###
[DEDUCTION]
 To determine whether Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community, we will carefully analyze the premises step-by-step and apply deductions.

---

### STEP 1: Resolve Bonnie's behavior from Premise 6
[Premise 6] states:  
Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events **and** is a student who attends the school,  
**OR**  
she neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor** is a student who attends the school.

Thus, Bonnie can only exist in one of these two mutually exclusive cases:  
1. **Case A**: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events **and** is a student who attends the school.  
2. **Case B**: Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor** is a student who attends the school.

---

### STEP 2: Use Premise 1 and Premise 2 to deduce conditions for engagement with school events
[Premise 1] states:  
If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.  

[Premise 2] states:  
People either perform in school talent shows often **or** are inactive and disinterested members of their community.  

From Premise 2, we know that people are split into two categories:  
1. Those who perform in school talent shows often.  
   Based on [Premise 1], these individuals attend and are very engaged with school events.  
2. Those who are inactive and disinterested members of their community.  
   Based on [Premise 4], these individuals chaperone high school dances.

This means **engagement with school events and being inactive/disinterested are opposites**.

---

### STEP 3: Determine if Bonnie can chaperone high school dances
[Premise 3] states:  
If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.  

[Premise 4] states:  
All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.  

From Premise 3 and Premise 4, we conclude:  
- Bonnie **cannot** be a student who attends the school **if** she chaperones high school dances.  
- Thus, anyone who chaperones high school dances **must** be inactive and disinterested.

---

### STEP 4: Use Premise 7 to eliminate contradictions
[Premise 7] states:  
Bonnie cannot both wish to further her academic career and chaperone high school dances.

We know from [Premise 5] that:  
Young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers **are students who attend the school**.  

Thus, if Bonnie **wishes to further her academic career**, she must be a student who attends the school.  
But, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances (from Premise 3 and Premise 4), she **cannot** be a student who attends the school.  

Therefore, Bonnie **cannot simultaneously** wish to further her academic career **and** chaperone high school dances.

---

### STEP 5: Deduce Bonnie's category
From Step 1, Bonnie must fall into one of two categories:
1. **Case A**: Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events **and** is a student who attends the school.  
   - In this case, Bonnie performs in school talent shows often (Premises 1 and 2).  
   - Bonnie cannot chaperone high school dances (Premise 3).  
2. **Case B**: Bonnie neither attends and is very engaged with school events **nor** is a student who attends the school.  
   - In this case, Bonnie **must** be an inactive and disinterested member of her community (Premise 2).  
   - Bonnie chaperones high school dances (Premises 3 and 4).  

---

### STEP 6: Answer the question
[Question]: Is the statement **"Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community"** true, false, or uncertain?

From Step 5, Bonnie must be in **Case A** or **Case B**.  
- If Bonnie is in Case A, she is a student who attends the school.  
- If Bonnie is in Case B, she is an inactive and disinterested member of her community.  

Thus, the statement **"Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community"** is **TRUE**.

### Explanation:
1. **Premises parsing**:  
   - Premises related to people performing talent shows often (`PerformTalentShowsOften`) and chaperoning dances (`ChaperoneHighSchoolDances`) are translated into logical implications.
   - Bonnie's binary cases for school engagement and student status are expressed using disjunction (`|`) and conjunction (`&`).

2. **Goal parsing**:
   - The question to evaluate is represented as a goal. It uses logical implications to express the condition where Bonnie is in Case A (attends school events, is engaged, and is a student) and checks whether this implies she is a student who does not chaperone dances.

If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.
Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Bonnie is in Case B, then she is inactive and disinterested in her community and chaperones high school dances.

### Explanation:
1. **Premises** are parsed systematically with universal quantifiers (`all x`) for general statements about people and their attributes/behaviors. Logical relationships are written using conditional (`->`), disjunction (`|`), conjunction (`&`), and negation (`-`) as needed.
2. Bonnie's premise regarding her attributes (Case A or Case B) is written as a disjunction: `(Attend(bonnie) & Engaged(bonnie) & Student(bonnie)) | (-Attend(bonnie) & -Engaged(bonnie) & -Student(bonnie))`.
3. **Goal statement** expresses conditional reasoning about Bonnie's inactivity, disinterest, and chaperoning in Case B (`-(Attend(bonnie) & Engaged(bonnie) & Student(bonnie))` leads to certain attributes).

Premises:
Bonnie must fall into one of two cases: Case A, where she attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or Case B, where she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.
If Bonnie is in Case A, then she is a student who attends the school and does not chaperone high school dances.
If Bonnie is in Case B, then she is inactive and disinterested in her community and chaperones high school dances.
Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
###
response:
Here's the Prover9 input file for the provided premises and question:

### Prover9 Input File:

```prover9

end_of_list.

formulas(goals).
(Student(bonnie) & AttendsSchool(bonnie)) | (Inactive(bonnie) & Disinterested(bonnie)).
end_of_list.
```

Explanation:
1. **Assumptions**:
   - The first premise states Bonnie must fall into one of two cases, Case A or Case B. This is modeled as `(CaseA(bonnie) | CaseB(bonnie))`.
   - The second premise specifies that if Bonnie is in Case A, then she is a student who attends the school and does not chaperone high school dances. This is represented as `CaseA(bonnie) -> (Student(bonnie) & AttendsSchool(bonnie) & -Chaperone(bonnie))`.
   - The third premise specifies that if Bonnie is in Case B, then she is inactive and disinterested in her community and chaperones high school dances. This is represented as `CaseB(bonnie) -> (Inactive(bonnie) & Disinterested(bonnie) & Chaperone(bonnie))`.

2. **Goal**:
   - The question asks if Bonnie is either (a) a student who attends the school or (b) an inactive and disinterested member of the community. This statement is represented as `(Student(bonnie) & AttendsSchool(bonnie)) | (Inactive(bonnie) & Disinterested(bonnie))`.

Premises:
Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Bonnie is either both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and chaperones high school dances or neither is a young child nor teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, then Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or is an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
###
response:
Here is the parsed Prover9 input file for the given premises and question:

```

((Student(bonnie) & AttendsSchool(bonnie)) | (-Active(bonnie) & -Interested(bonnie))).
end_of_list.
```

### Explanation:
1. **Premises** - The statement "Bonnie is either a student who attends the school or an inactive and disinterested member of the community" is directly translated into the assumption block using a disjunction:
   ```
   (Student(bonnie) & AttendsSchool(bonnie)) | (-Active(bonnie) & -Interested(bonnie)).
   ```

2. **Conclusion** - The question involves a conditional statement regarding Bonnie's attributes. The statement is parsed into the goal block using nested conjunctions (`&`), disjunctions (`|`), and negations (`-`):
   ```
   ((YoungChild(bonnie) | Teenager(bonnie)) & WishesToFurtherCareer(bonnie) & ChaperonesDances(bonnie)) | 
   (-YoungChild(bonnie) & -Teenager(bonnie) & -WishesToFurtherCareer(bonnie)) -> 
   ((Student(bonnie) & AttendsSchool(bonnie)) | (-Active(bonnie) & -Interested(bonnie))).
   ```

This structure follows Prover9's syntax and ensures proper logical representation of the provided information.

[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Bonnie either chaperones high school dances or, if she does not, she performs in school talent shows often, then Bonnie is both a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities and an inactive and disinterested member of the community.


response:
To determine the answer, let us analyze the premises and deduce step-by-step whether the provided statement is **true**, **false**, or **uncertain**. Let's dissect the problem.

---

### Restatement of the premises and their implications:
1. **Premise 1:**  
   If people perform in school talent shows often, then they:  
   \[ \text{attend and are very engaged with school events.} \]  

   This implies that performing in talent shows means being actively engaged in the school community.

2. **Premise 2:**  
   People are either:  
   \[ \text{(a) Performers in school talent shows often, or } \]  
   \[ \text{(b) Inactive and disinterested members of their community.} \]  

   This indicates a dichotomy: a person cannot belong to both categories simultaneously, and they must belong to one.

3. **Premise 3:**  
   If people chaperone high school dances, then:  
   \[ \text{They are not students who attend the school.} \]  

   Chaperoning implies that the person is not a student.

4. **Premise 4:**  
   All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community:  
   \[ \text{Chaperone high school dances.} \]  

   Everyone in the "inactive and disinterested" category chaperones dances.

5. **Premise 5:**  
   All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities:  
   \[ \text{Are students who attend the school.} \]  

   If someone is a young student aiming to advance academically, they must attend school.

6. **Premise 6:**  
   Bonnie either:  
   \[ \text{(a) Attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student at the school, or } \]  
   \[ \text{(b) Neither attends nor is engaged with school events, and is not a student at the school.} \]  

   Bonnie exists in one of these two mutually exclusive possibilities:
   - (a) Active student (engaged and attends school), or
   - (b) Non-student and inactive/disengaged.

---

### Question restatement:
**If Bonnie either:**
1. **(i)** Chaperones high school dances,  
   **or, if not**  
2. **(ii)** Performs in school talent shows often,  

**then:**  
Bonnie is both:  
1. **(i)** A young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, and  
2. **(ii)** An inactive and disinterested member of the community.

We need to **assess the truth of this "if-then" statement**.

---

### Step-by-step deduction:
#### Step 1: If Bonnie chaperones high school dances.
- By **Premise 3**, anyone who chaperones high school dances is not a student at the school.
- By **Premise 4**, chaperoning high school dances also means being an **inactive and disinterested member of the community**.
- By **Premise 5**, if Bonnie is not a student, she cannot be a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career.
- Therefore:
  - If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she cannot be both:
    - A young child or teenager pursuing academic goals (she fails this criterion because she is not a student), and
    - An inactive and disinterested community member (this criterion is true due to Premise 4).

#### Step 2: If Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances but performs in school talent shows often.
- By **Premise 1**, performing in talent shows implies that Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events.
- By **Premise 2**, performing in talent shows means Bonnie is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
- By **Premise 6**, if Bonnie is engaged with school events, she must also be a student at the school.
- By **Premise 5**, if Bonnie is a student at the school, she is also a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career.
- Therefore:
  - If Bonnie performs in school talent shows, she **is not** an inactive and disinterested community member.

#### Step 3: Evaluate the "if-then" statement.
- The statement claims:  
  **If Bonnie either:**
  1. Chaperones high school dances,  
  **or, if not**  
  2. Performs in school talent shows often,  
  **then:**  
  Bonnie is both:
  1. A young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career, and  
  2. An inactive and disinterested member of the community.

- From **Step 1**, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career. The statement is false in this case.
- From **Step 2**, if Bonnie performs in school talent shows, she is not an inactive and disinterested community member. The statement is false in this case too.

---

### Final Answer:
The statement is **FALSE**.  

The conditions described in the question cannot simultaneously satisfy the "then" clause (Bonnie being both a young academic-focused child/teen and inactive).

[DEDUCTION]
 To determine the answer, let us analyze the premises and deduce step-by-step whether the provided statement is **true**, **false**, or **uncertain**. Let's dissect the problem.

---

### Restatement of the premises and their implications:
1. **Premise 1:**  
   If people perform in school talent shows often, then they:  
   \[ \text{attend and are very engaged with school events.} \]  

   This implies that performing in talent shows means being actively engaged in the school community.

2. **Premise 2:**  
   People are either:  
   \[ \text{(a) Performers in school talent shows often, or } \]  
   \[ \text{(b) Inactive and disinterested members of their community.} \]  

   This indicates a dichotomy: a person cannot belong to both categories simultaneously, and they must belong to one.

3. **Premise 3:**  
   If people chaperone high school dances, then:  
   \[ \text{They are not students who attend the school.} \]  

   Chaperoning implies that the person is not a student.

4. **Premise 4:**  
   All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community:  
   \[ \text{Chaperone high school dances.} \]  

   Everyone in the "inactive and disinterested" category chaperones dances.

5. **Premise 5:**  
   All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities:  
   \[ \text{Are students who attend the school.} \]  

   If someone is a young student aiming to advance academically, they must attend school.

6. **Premise 6:**  
   Bonnie either:  
   \[ \text{(a) Attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student at the school, or } \]  
   \[ \text{(b) Neither attends nor is engaged with school events, and is not a student at the school.} \]  

   Bonnie exists in one of these two mutually exclusive possibilities:
   - (a) Active student (engaged and attends school), or
   - (b) Non-student and inactive/disengaged.

---

### Question restatement:
**If Bonnie either:**
1. **(i)** Chaperones high school dances,  
   **or, if not**  
2. **(ii)** Performs in school talent shows often,  

**then:**  
Bonnie is both:  
1. **(i)** A young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career and educational opportunities, and  
2. **(ii)** An inactive and disinterested member of the community.

We need to **assess the truth of this "if-then" statement**.

---

### Step-by-step deduction:
#### Step 1: If Bonnie chaperones high school dances.
- By **Premise 3**, anyone who chaperones high school dances is not a student at the school.
- By **Premise 4**, chaperoning high school dances also means being an **inactive and disinterested member of the community**.
- By **Premise 5**, if Bonnie is not a student, she cannot be a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career.
- Therefore:
  - If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she cannot be both:
    - A young child or teenager pursuing academic goals (she fails this criterion because she is not a student), and
    - An inactive and disinterested community member (this criterion is true due to Premise 4).

#### Step 2: If Bonnie does not chaperone high school dances but performs in school talent shows often.
- By **Premise 1**, performing in talent shows implies that Bonnie attends and is very engaged with school events.
- By **Premise 2**, performing in talent shows means Bonnie is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community.
- By **Premise 6**, if Bonnie is engaged with school events, she must also be a student at the school.
- By **Premise 5**, if Bonnie is a student at the school, she is also a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career.
- Therefore:
  - If Bonnie performs in school talent shows, she **is not** an inactive and disinterested community member.

#### Step 3: Evaluate the "if-then" statement.
- The statement claims:  
  **If Bonnie either:**
  1. Chaperones high school dances,  
  **or, if not**  
  2. Performs in school talent shows often,  
  **then:**  
  Bonnie is both:
  1. A young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career, and  
  2. An inactive and disinterested member of the community.

- From **Step 1**, if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, she is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career. The statement is false in this case.
- From **Step 2**, if Bonnie performs in school talent shows, she is not an inactive and disinterested community member. The statement is false in this case too.

---

### Final Answer:
The statement is **FALSE**.  

The conditions described in the question cannot simultaneously satisfy the "then" clause (Bonnie being both a young academic-focused child/teen and inactive).

Premises:
If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school
All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school
Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career.
###
response:
Here's the Prover9 input file for the given premises and question:

```
formulas(assumptions).
all x (Chaperone(x) -> -Student(x)).
all x ((YoungChild(x) & Student(x)) | (Teenager(x) & Student(x)) -> FurtherAcademicCareer(x) & EducationalOpportunities(x)).

formulas(goals).
Chaperone(bonnie) -> -(YoungChild(bonnie) | Teenager(bonnie)).
exists x (Chaperone(x) & FurtherAcademicCareer(x)).
end_of_list.
```

Explanation:
- The first premise states that if someone chaperones high school dances, they are not students who attend the school. This is expressed as `all x (Chaperone(x) -> -Student(x)).`.
- The second premise states that all young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities must be students who attend the school. This was simplified logically into `all x ((YoungChild(x) & Student(x)) | (Teenager(x) & Student(x)) -> FurtherAcademicCareer(x) & EducationalOpportunities(x)).`.
- "Bonnie chaperoning high school dances" is translated into the question to determine if it logically entails the goal statement `Chaperone(bonnie) -> -(YoungChild(bonnie) | Teenager(bonnie)).`.

[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career.


response:
To determine the truth value of the statement in question — "If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career" — we need to deduce the answer step by step using the premises provided.

---

### **Step 1: Break Down the Relevant Information**
The situation involves multiple premises explaining connections between attending school events, performing in talent shows, being a chaperone, being a student, and wishing to further academic and educational careers. Let’s summarize:

1. **Premise 1:** If people perform in school talent shows often → they attend and are very engaged with school events.
2. **Premise 2:** People either perform in school talent shows often OR are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
3. **Premise 3:** If people chaperone high school dances → they are **not students** who attend the school.
4. **Premise 4:** All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community → they chaperone high school dances.
5. **Premise 5:** All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers → they are **students** who attend the school.
6. **Premise 6:** Bonnie either:
   - BOTH attends and is very engaged with school events AND is a student who attends the school, OR
   - NEITHER attends school events nor is a student who attends the school.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze What Happens If Bonnie Chaperones High School Dances**
From **Premise 3**, we know that if Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is **not a student who attends the school**.

- From **Premise 5**, all young children and teenagers wishing to further their academic careers are **students** who attend the school.
  - Therefore, if Bonnie is **not a student who attends the school**, it must also be true that she is **not a young child or teenager wishing to further her academic career**.

Thus, Bonnie **cannot** be a young child or teenager wishing to further her academic career **if she is chaperoning high school dances**.

---

### **Step 3: Ensure Logical Consistency With Other Premises**
- Returning to **Premise 4**, inactive and disinterested members of the community chaperone high school dances. This is consistent with the deductions above because Bonnie, not being a student, could chaperone dances if she were inactive and disinterested.

- According to **Premise 6**, Bonnie must either:
  - Be very engaged with school events and a student (this would contradict her being a chaperone, due to **Premise 3**), OR
  - Neither attend school events nor be a student (consistent with her being a chaperone).

---

### **Step 4: Final Deduction**
If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then based on **Premise 3** and **Premise 5**, she **cannot be a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career**. This is logically valid and consistent with all the premises provided.

---

### **Answer: TRUE**

### Explanation of Translation

1. **Premises:**
   - Universal quantifications (`all x ...`) are used for generalized rules.
   - Logical constructs such as `->` (implication), `&` (conjunction), and `|` (disjunction) are applied appropriately to formalize the premises.

2. **Conclusion (Goal):**
   - The goal is expressed as a universal quantification, where the negation of being a student implies the negation of being a young child or teenager desiring further academic opportunities.

3. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Variables (`x`) are universally quantified or used within formulas to represent arbitrary persons.
   - Bonnie is directly referenced as a specific individual where appropriate (`bonnie`).

4. **Consistency:**
   - All formulas end with a period (`.`), as required by the Prover9 format.
   - Each premise is separate and clearly stated within the `formulas(assumptions)` block.
   - The query (goal) is stated in the `formulas(goals)` block.

### Explanation:
1. **Premises:**
   - The premise provided states: "If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school."
     This is directly formalized as:
     `all x (Chaperones(x) -> -Student(x)).` 
     It uses the universal quantification `all x`, logical "implies" (`->`), and negation (`-`).

2. **Question:**
   - The question asks whether: "If a person chaperones high school dances, then they are not a student who attends the school."
     This is identical to the premise, so the same formula is placed under `formulas(goals)`.

3. **Structure:**
   - The premise is placed between `formulas(assumptions).` and `end_of_list.`
   - The question (statement to be proved) is placed between `formulas(goals).` and `end_of_list.`

### Explanation

1. **Premises Parsing**:  
   - All premises were encoded using appropriate logical connectives (`->`, `&`, `|`, and `-`) and quantifiers (`all x`, `exists x`).
   - Each logical relationship in the premises is directly expressed as a formula.
  
2. **Goal Parsing**:  
   - The question was transformed into a goal formula for proving. Specifically, it checks if Bonnie chaperoning high school dances implies that she is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career (`ChaperoneDances -> -(YoungChild & Teenager & WishFurtherAcademicCareer)`).

This file is formatted correctly for Prover9 input and is ready to be tested in the prover.

Write a step-by-step deduction to solve the following question:
[PREMISE 1] If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.
[PREMISE 2] People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.
[PREMISE 3] If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 4] All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.
[PREMISE 5] All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.
[PREMISE 6] Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.

You can use the following hints as additional premises. They are proposed in your former trials and are proved to be true through rigid verification:
[PREMISE 7] If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then she is not a young child or teenager who wishes to further her academic career.
[PREMISE 8] If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she is very engaged with school events.

[QUESTION] Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community.


response:
Let’s break down this question step by step using logical deduction and the given premises.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the question.
The question is: **If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community.**
We need to determine if this statement is *true*, *false*, or *uncertain* based on the provided premises.

---

### Step 2: Translate relevant premises into logical structures.
From the premises, we can infer the following logical relationships:

1. **Premise 1 (P1)**:  
   If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.  
   **Translation**:  
   \( A \rightarrow B \), where:  
   - \( A \): "Performs in school talent shows often."  
   - \( B \): "Attends and is very engaged with school events."

2. **Premise 2 (P2)**:   
   People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.  
   **Translation**:  
   \( A \vee C \), where:  
   - \( A \): "Performs in school talent shows often."  
   - \( C \): "Inactive and disinterested member of the community."

3. **Premise 8 (P8)**:  
   If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she is very engaged with school events.  
   **Translation**:  
   \( A \rightarrow B \).

4. **Premise 6 (P6)**:  
   Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events *and* is a student who attends the school, *or* she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.  
   **Translation**:  
   \( (B \land D) \vee (\neg B \land \neg D) \), where:  
   - \( B \): "Attends and is very engaged with school events."  
   - \( D \): "Student who attends the school."

---

### Step 3: Understand the relationship between "inactive and disinterested" and "performing in talent shows."
From **Premise 2 (P2)**, we know that:
- People either perform in school talent shows often (\( A \)) or are inactive and disinterested members of the community (\( C \)).
- This means that \( A \) and \( C \) are mutually exclusive:  
  \( \neg(A \land C) \).  
  In other words, if someone performs in school talent shows often (\( A \)), they cannot be an inactive and disinterested member of the community (\( C \)).  
  Thus, \( A \rightarrow \neg C \).

---

### Step 4: Verify consistency with the question.
The statement in the question is: **If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often (\( A \)), then she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community (\( \neg C \)).**

From the deduction in **Step 3**, \( A \rightarrow \neg C \) matches the logical conclusion derived from **Premise 2 (P2)**. This is directly supported by the mutual exclusivity of \( A \) and \( C \).

---

### Step 5: Final conclusion.
The statement "**If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community**" is **TRUE**.

### Step 1: Analyze the question.
The question is: **If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community.**
We need to determine if this statement is *true*, *false*, or *uncertain* based on the provided premises.

### Step 2: Translate relevant premises into logical structures.
From the premises, we can infer the following logical relationships:

1. **Premise 1 (P1)**:  
   If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.  
   **Translation**:  
   \( A \rightarrow B \), where:  
   - \( A \): "Performs in school talent shows often."  
   - \( B \): "Attends and is very engaged with school events."

2. **Premise 2 (P2)**:   
   People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.  
   **Translation**:  
   \( A \vee C \), where:  
   - \( A \): "Performs in school talent shows often."  
   - \( C \): "Inactive and disinterested member of the community."

3. **Premise 8 (P8)**:  
   If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she is very engaged with school events.  
   **Translation**:  
   \( A \rightarrow B \).

4. **Premise 6 (P6)**:  
   Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events *and* is a student who attends the school, *or* she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.  
   **Translation**:  
   \( (B \land D) \vee (\neg B \land \neg D) \), where:  
   - \( B \): "Attends and is very engaged with school events."  
   - \( D \): "Student who attends the school."

---

### Step 3: Understand the relationship between "inactive and disinterested" and "performing in talent shows."
From **Premise 2 (P2)**, we know that:
- People either perform in school talent shows often (\( A \)) or are inactive and disinterested members of the community (\( C \)).
- This means that \( A \) and \( C \) are mutually exclusive:  
  \( \neg(A \land C) \).  
  In other words, if someone performs in school talent shows often (\( A \)), they cannot be an inactive and disinterested member of the community (\( C \)).  
  Thus, \( A \rightarrow \neg C \).

---

### Step 4: Verify consistency with the question.
The statement in the question is: **If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often (\( A \)), then she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community (\( \neg C \)).**

From the deduction in **Step 3**, \( A \rightarrow \neg C \) matches the logical conclusion derived from **Premise 2 (P2)**. This is directly supported by the mutual exclusivity of \( A \) and \( C \).

---

### Step 5: Final conclusion.
The statement "**If Bonnie performs in school talent shows often, then she is not an inactive and disinterested member of the community**" is **TRUE**.


###
Please follow these guidelines:
- Summarize the deduction above by extracting the subconclution and its proofs in each step.
- The line of the i-th subconclusion should start with "[SUBCONCLUSION i]" EXACTLY, and do NOT use line feed in one subconclusion.
- In the next line of each subconclusion, list its proofs using indices, like "premise i, premise j,..., subconclusion k, subconclusion l". This line should start with "[PROOFS]" EXACTLY, and do NOT use line feed.
- Each subconclusion is a CLEAN conclusion without its proof, analysis, and other problems.
- Denote the answer of true, false or uncertain with a line starting with "[ANSWER]", and also don't forget to list its proofs in the next line strating with [PROOFS]. 

- Do NOT write subconclusions identical to any of the given premises and the question.
- Do NOT write subconclusions that are more complex than the original problems or contain other problems. The subconclusions should be SIMPLER than the given problem.
- Do NOT include proof, analysis, and other problems in each subconclusions.
