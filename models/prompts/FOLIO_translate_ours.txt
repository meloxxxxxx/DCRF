Given the premises and a question, the task is to parse the premises and the question into a complete Prover9 input file.
The format of the Prover9 input file is as follows:
1) All premises must be placed between 'formulas(assumptions).' and 'end_of_list.'.
2) The conclusion to be proved must be placed between 'formulas(goals).' and 'end_of_list.'.
3) All formulas must end with a period (.).
4) Use '-' for negation, '&' for conjunction, and '|' for disjunction.
5) Use 'all x (...)' for universal quantification and 'exists x (...)' for existential quantification.
